<P>MJ12 is tracking all my emails, social network accounts and transmissions. The old-fashioned pen and paper is more secure. I don't want them to know how feel. I am in distress

<P>Since I came back to the Moon there wasn't a day that I didn't think about <B>Tantalus</B>

<P>He broke my heart but I know he was right. MJ12 put us together artificially. You can't 'arrange' true love.

<P>Still in the back of my mind I long for him to come rescue me from my selenic castle and defeat Ada the dragon. If only there was a way for me to contact him
<DC=138,43,226>

<P>if only he knew I would leave MJ12 if I could, if I weren't sick

<P>Jane thinks I should 'move on' but she is wrong. I don't care that my escape from Rifleman Bank station was staged - Tantalus showed me the outside world for the first time. He loved me the way I am, with my bionic spine when everybody else looked at me like I am a freak. He even loved me when we found out I cannot have children after Paul was born. He even supported me when I agreed to the Versalife surgery and when I was pregnant with JC, our miracle baby.

<P>MJ12 seems to be unstoppable. They took everything away from me, Tantalus, my children, my freedom and my health. I hope one day Tantalus will come back and kick their ass!
