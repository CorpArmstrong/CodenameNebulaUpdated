<P>Al,
<P>Thanks, bro. No more waiting for admin credentials! I can finally log in to any terminal and play around with Internet of Things. I owe you, man!

<P>Trevor,
<P>I trolled the Captain last night when he was drunk and the old man gave me his password! He said it's God from machine in Portuguese, with underscores. So like this: deus_da_maquina. His username is CaptainV. I'm pretty certain the captain has no recollection of last night. 
<P>--Alan.
