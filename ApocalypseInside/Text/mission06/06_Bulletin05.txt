<P>
<P>Work on nano-technology began in the early 2020's, and the Majestic 12 scientists assigned to the project (including Bob Page) had their work <P>cut out for them. Mechanical augmentations were just starting to become widespread. Nanites would certainly be the next-generation technology <P>available for augmentations -- but a number of hurdles had to be overcome. A self-replicating nanite that could interact with biological <P>material had to be developed. The nanites also had to be able to interpret commands from the human mind, and to send visual and audio data to <P>that mind in a form it could accept, layered on top of the subject's normal eyesight and hearing. All of these technologies would take years <P>to develop. 
<P>
<P>What Majestic 12 needed was a test subject matching their selection criteria, and as young as possible.
<P>
<P>How to find such a test subject? The Illuminati -- then in power, though no one knew it -- had done a great, secret census between 1940 and <P>1965, tracking everyone who received a small pox vaccine. From this they were able to build a database of the genetic codes of nearly all <P>citizens of the United States and much of the rest of the world. 
<P>
<P>The conspirators' agents, posing as nurses and doctors, in pediatricians' offices and elementary schools across the nation, used the smallpox <P>census data, to keep track of high potential candidates. The specialists in charge of the project were updated regularly on the progress of <P>potential candidates. All the conspirators had to do was wait. Magdalene and Tantalus Denton -- two such potential candidates -- fell in love - with some help from the conspirators - and produced young Paul under the watchful, albeit covert eye of Majestic 12 operatives who 
<P>played the parts of friends, family doctors, neighbors, school teachers and so on...
<P>
<P>When Paul Denton was five, Majestic 12 scientists determined that his physique and genetic makeup were the most suitable for the nano-<P>augmentation project. His immune system was excellent, yet he had no allergic reactions to non-biological foreign materials in his body. He <P>also had no predispositions to myopia, obesity, or heart disease, and he was highly intelligent. 
<P>
<P>The scientists selected Paul as their test subject. Now they needed to find the precise spots in his brain where the nanites could intercept <P>neural transmissions and convert them to commands. (These spots are different for every human being.) They also needed to implant nano-<P>augmentations in Paul's body and test them. 
<P>
<P>Since Paul himself was considered too valuable to experiment on, Majestic 12 scientists created a number of clones of Paul. These clones were <P>allowed to grow until their brains (especially the language centers) were fully developed. Then the scientists performed experiments on each <P>of the child clones, trying to find the "sweet spots" in the brain that would allow the clones to control nanites and receive information.
<P>
<P>For most of the clones, the experiments failed, and the clones were left as drooling vegetables -- or worse. Many of these failed experiments <P>were destroyed. A few were allowed to live, so the scientists could perform further physiological and nano-technological studies on them as <P>they grew older. 
<P>
<P>In one or two cases, though, the experiments were successful. These successes proved to the cabal leaders that direct mental control of nano-<P>technology was possible. 
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, Paul started to grow up, blissfully unaware of the experiments being carried out in his name... 
<P>
<P>Paul's mother, who was unable to have any more children but wanted another, was approached by Majestic 12 operatives posing as fertility <P>experts. She was told that she would be paid handsomely in exchange for participating in experimental surgery that would allow her to become <P>pregnant. For Mrs. Denton, who'd been poor all her life, this was a dream come true -- she could have another child AND have enough money to <P>raise her family in comfort. The "fertility experts" assured her that the surgery was minor and the risk was minimal.
<P>
<P>She and her husband agreed to the experiment, unaware that their lives had been closely monitored by the cabal for many years. Although <P>Paul's mother believed that the surgery would let her become pregnant again, in reality the Majestic 12 operatives implanted her with a <P>cloned embryo of Paul. 
<P>
<P>Nine months later, J.C. Denton was born. Paul and J.C. were raised as brothers, under the careful and clandestine scrutiny of Majestic 12. <P>Their parents never knew that the children were identical twins born eleven years apart.
<P>
<P>At the same time, Majestic 12 continued to grow more clones and test nano-technology on them. Prior to J.C. Denton's birth, this was a <P>cumbersome process. Each clone had to be grown in the womb of a mother, so the number of clones the scientists could produce was limited to <P>the number of women employed by Majestic 12 who were willing to endure nine months of pregnancy in relative secrecy. This, as you can <P>imagine, was not a large number. There was another disadvantage: each clone was gestating inside a different womb, each mother had a <P>different metabolism, and as a result each clone was slightly different. The scientists had failed to reckon with the effects of pregnancy on <P>their clones. 
<P>
<P>Fortunately for the nano-augmentation program, technology marched onward. Shortly after J.C. was born, scientists invented an incubator that <P>could bring a clone to term from the embryonic stage. The number of clones available for experiments grew dramatically, and the doctors could <P>now perform their experiments with "control" clones. The pace of progress increased. 
<P>
<P>When Paul was 17 and J.C. was 6, it was becoming clear that Paul was a bit too unpredictable and independent for Majestic 12's tastes. Their <P>leaders decided that J.C. should be raised in a more controlled environment, one in which the conspiracy's operatives would have direct <P>involvement in his upbringing. To that end, they arranged to have his parents killed by a terrorist faction under Majestic 12 control. Paul <P>was deemed expendable, and he was scheduled to die in the same attack.
<P>
<P>To the surprise of the conspirators, Paul not only survived the attack that killed his parents, but also vowed to join UNATCO to avenge his <P>parents' deaths. By this point UNATCO was nearly under the cabal's thumb, so Majestic 12 decided to let him live and work at the anti-<P>terrorist agency, where they could keep a close eye on him. After all, Paul might be useful in the future, perhaps as a guinea pig for J.C.'s <P>eventual nano-augmentation.
<P>
<P>J.C., now a ward of the state, was sent to a special Swiss school (actually a front for Majestic 12) where his development could be more <P>carefully controlled. The school tried to instill into J.C. an unquestioning loyalty to his superiors and a willingness to follow orders. <P>Although the conditioning seemed to work, J.C. despised the school's rigid disciplinary style and developed a rebellious attitude that he <P>kept hidden. 
<P>
<P>Paul, who was raised to adulthood by his parents, was flamboyant and happy-go-lucky, while his younger brother J.C. spent most of his <P>childhood in Swiss schools and became serious, bitter and a little paranoid. 
<P>
<P>Although Paul was busy with his duties at UNATCO, he still visited J.C. as often as he could. J.C. worshipped his older brother: Paul the <P>UNATCO Agent, with his James Bond lifestyle and noble cause. J.C. decided to join UNATCO as soon as he was old enough. This fit in perfectly <P>with Majestic 12's plans. 
<P>
<P>Shortly before J.C. signed up for UNATCO, Majestic 12 felt they were ready to try nano-augmentation on Paul Denton. UNATCO agents approached <P>Paul, telling him he was a rare candidate for an experimental procedure that would make him stronger and faster -- an augmented human being <P>without the clunky mechanical appendages. Paul had no idea that this offer was the culmination of nearly 25 years of behind-the-scenes <P>experiments and manipulations on his life. He agreed.
<P>
<P>A few years later, J.C. also became a UNATCO agent, and was offered the same procedure. He also accepted. In both cases, the augmentations <P>were unqualified successes. 
<P>
<P>The underground shadow conspiracy known as Majestic 12 now had two nano-augmented agents in their ranks. A few more experiments, a little <P>more testing, and the conspirators would be poised to create an army of unstoppable super-humans. Majestic 12 was closer to its goal of total <P>world domination than it had ever been.
