United Nations and various national military space planes make regular flights to two relatively large orbiting space stations (international efforts owned by no single country but, secretly, controlled by Majestic 12). These stations are used as research labs and fabrication facilities by scientists and industry with the approval of the conspirators. However, the first mega-expensive resort hotel, called Heaven, is due to open soon, a safe haven for the wealthy and a getaway for adventurous travelers with good connections and LOTS of money. (Heaven is a front for Majestic 12 operations of all sorts.)

There are enough satellites in orbit that traffic is becoming a problem and accidents hardly make the news anymore.

As far as life on other planets goes, we still haven’t encountered any, at least none that can be acknowledged publicly – rumors continue to abound that we were visited by aliens a century or more ago and the governments of the world are keeping it secret.

The only acknowledged life on other planets is human life – there’s a small, permanent Moon base populated by scientists – purely experimental stuff – and a mostly robot-controlled lunar mining facility. Mankind has explored Mars about as much as we explored the Moon in the 1960’s. In other words, it’s possible to get there but no one much cares. Far more interesting to most people is the asteroid field between Mars and Jupiter. It’s currently mined by robots designed for the purpose but Majestic 12 has big plans for the exploitation of the asteroid field’s immense resources.
