<P><JC>Prediction of the State of Economy From 1999</JC>

<P>The economics of the world in the near future will show two significant changes. First, inflation will drive prices up, as more of America becomes focused on consumerism rather than manufacturing. Also, most of the rest of the world will convert to a single economy and a world monetary system, causing the world credit to become more powerful and U.S. credit to devalue considerably. There are some additional effects due to stock market drops in both the NASDAQ and NYSE. Greater social and economic dichotomies have caused unrest at all levels.
