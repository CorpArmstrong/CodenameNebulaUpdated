<P><JC>Cargo Blunder Causes Catastrophic Explosion</JC>
<P>Ibadan, Nigeria.

<P>The aftermath of the devastating Moon cargo crash in the West African country is believed to live up to the most pessimistic of expectations. The 20-kilotone explosion, more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, has already millions on its death-roll, leaving alone the damage it has done to the city and the nature. This disaster was ‘purely of human mistake in origin’, Chinese governmental officials say, and ‘the workers, responsible for that are already sentenced to execution by the Prime Minister of PRC’. This action of China towards its workers is already criticized by the governments of the United States and Nigeria. Nigeria was disputing with China over the right to build a mining complex on the Moon for years already. A Canada-based corporation, McMoran global steel, chose to sign the contract with China to build a mining complex on the Moon and equip it with the state-of-art cannon used for quick cargo and personnel delivery to and from Earth, the cannon we call the Mass Driver. ‘If this thing would have been caused by a blunder’, the Nigerian spokesman says, ‘the shipment would have more chances to land at the speed of thousands of kilometers per hour somewhere in China than in Nigeria. Our country is tenfold smaller by territory than China!’
Does China possess a new weapon, not less death-bringing than nuclear missiles, that can shoot death from the sky? It is time America’s dealt with the decades-lasting economic crisis and start funding the project of its own Mass Driver facility on the Moon!
