<P>
<P>Exhibit name: Soviet ICBM
<P>Danger level: Extremely high
<P>Date of aquisition: 1995
<P>
<P>Notes:
<P>As part of nuclear Non-Proliferation USSR marked this missile disassembled. After the collapse of the Soviet Union our people had to take this when they left due to the steady growth of the FSB influence. This is one of the most powerful thermonuclear warheads ever created by the Russkies, so MAKE SURE THIS FUCKING THING IS STEADILY SECURED and doesn't fall from the cargo surface. Not to be captain Obvious, but if it explodes we're all dead. Plus, its American neighbor will make it double trouble...
