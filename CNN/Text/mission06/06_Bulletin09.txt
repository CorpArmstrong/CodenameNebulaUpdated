<P>
<P>Notes: After Ernst Schafer came back from Tibet, Ahnenerbe sent two more secret expeditions who to prove that early Aryans had conquered much of Asia. One was on the Canary Islands based on Darre's theory that Atlantians were Aryans. Second was an experition to Norway, organized by Heinrich Himmer in complete secret. The Norse mission discovered an ancient Buddha statue thousands of miles away from Southeast Asia. This discovery, if presented to experts, would prove Nazi presumption that Gautama Buddha was himself an Aryan offspring of the Nordic race. Because of the defeat of the Third Reich the Illuminati council of 5 decided to hide the discovery, fearing it would generate a wave of neo-Nazism in China and subsequent Jewish oppression.
