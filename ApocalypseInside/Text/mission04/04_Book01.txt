<P><JC>Alter Ego: BLACK LIGHT</JC>
<P><JC>By Thomas D</JC>
<P>The Sun set.
<P>Gilgamesh shook all over. Blinded by the feelings, it took him a few moments to realize the world shook as well.
Taking Ciel-Monique in his arms to protect her, Mesh stood there, terrified by the enormous crack growing in the city of Angels.
<P>Los Angeles was sinking into the San Andreas Fault.
<P>The newborn lights on Sunset Boulevard have now gone dark, the Hollywood sign now read ‘llywocd’ and Mesh could swear one of the skyscrapers in Downtown collapsed.
A gigantic wave was born on the horizon, as the sky started to shed tears. Shocked by the sound of four million screams, Mesh watched the tsunami cast its shadow over Santa Monica, consuming the Ferris wheel, movie studios, mansions…
<P>From the San Gabriel Mountains, Mesh and Ciel-Monique could see his neighborhood, his home and his family perishing underwater.
The reality has just re-shaped itself. Mesh realized that it’s never going to be the same again.
The earthquake took away everything from Gilgamesh except for Ciel-Monique, but at least she was safe at the elevation of 1,134 feet…

<P>…Until the firmament split open and the moment tore itself apart with the sound of an explosion. The thunder and the lightning hit at the same time—just a few feet away from Ciel-Monique.
She glued to Gilgamesh, hearing him lie that it’s all over.
Against all common sense, the lightning struck again into a tree not too far away from the two.
<P>It was time to run.
<P>As they ran along the hiking path, the Lightning stuck at least ten times, each time into a tree closer and closer to the couple.
When they finally reached the lawn in front of the Observatory, Mesh realized he couldn’t hear the screaming of the panicking crowd. Everybody was fleeing hysterically, avoiding the trees, monuments and high objects, which made it impossible for the couple to run; they had to squeeze themselves through the crowd.
Mesh was still deafened by the sound of thunder when they finally reached their van, and Hank and Jean’s words were not audible to Mesh. All he could understand was that the Lightning was chasing them, and it was Mesh who had the keys to the van.
Fueled by adrenaline and anger, Gilgamesh started the van and almost immediately crashed into the nearest lamppost.
Whether his hearing returned or Hank shouted louder, Mesh heard his brother command him to move away from the lamppost.
<P>As soon as he did that, the lamppost was destroyed by another bolt of lightning.

<P>As Mesh was racing away from the flooded streets of Los Angeles, it became obvious that the Lightning was pursuing their van. One and the same Lightning zigzagged through the billboards and bridges like a cheetah chasing its prey, looking for a moment to strike and blinding the driver in the van.
Ciel-Monique was not screaming anymore, she squeezed her engagement ring, picturing herself as a bride, fantasizing about her marriage.
<P>Her phobia became theirs.
<P>Hank kept telling Gilgamesh to drive to the Mojave Desert, justifying it by absence of clouds in the desert, therefore, absence of lightning.
After hours of pursuit, the van reached the empty roads of the Mojave Desert, with the starry sky free of clouds. The Lightning lost them, as if tired of racing. Ciel-Monique fainted as soon as they left the city, but she was breathing.
