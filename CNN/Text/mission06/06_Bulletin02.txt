<P>Notes:
<P>As part of nuclear Non-Proliferation USSR marked this missile disassembled. After the collapse of the Soviet Union our people had to take this when they left due to the steady growth of the FSB influence. This is one of the most powerful thermonuclear warheads ever created by the Russkies. Its plutonium and enriched uranium components were removed before the missile arrived at Ophelia so that the bomb is no threat to Ophelia's safety. The payload was subsequently used in operation New West Coast.
