<P>

<P>Date of aquisition: 2014
<P>
<P>Notes: This is all what's left from Boeing 777, including its black box. A flaperon was dropped into the sea near Reunion to make sure the public is convinced the plane drowned. In order to cover up the kidnapping operation the Council created a set of hoax theories, my favorite being the one that alludes to Stephen King's the Langoliers. It's pretty cool to think that it's not the plane that's disappeared but WE have! :)
