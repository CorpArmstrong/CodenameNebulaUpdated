<P>There are too many stupid people, they see patriotism where there is fascism, they see faith where there is ignorance and love where there is libido! Use social engineering on these people or if you can’t get rid of them. Tantalus pretends to be a non-lethal saint, but little does he know it’s vanity. For every life Tantalus will spare, there will be a life that you’ll take.
