<P>Dive into the scenery
<P>From mountains to the seas
<P>Back from hell and mysery
<P>We're running on the wings!
<P>
<P>Should you stay I'll stay with you
<P>To push out sinking walls
<P>Should you cry I'll cry for you
<P>Together, evermore!
<P>
<P>Evermore, nevermore, forevermore.
<P>
<P>I'm with you and free at last,
<P>Apostles of the Christ,
<P>Firmament was waiting us
<P>as we fell off from the skies,
<P>
<P>Should you die I'll bring you back,
<P>To say, o Magdalene,
<P>In our world of fantasies
<P>We'll live eternally.
<P>
<P>It's Magdalene for Tantalus,
<P>My heart is suicide,
<P>The story of the Universe:
<P>Apocalypse Inside!
